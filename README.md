# Prosper's-Loan-Dataset
The project focuses on data visualization. The goal is to investigate the dataset and draw some insights from the loan data gathered by prosper

## Dataset
The dataset discusses loan data gotten from Propser. A total of 113,937 loan records with 81 features for each loan was provided for the data exploration. These features are not limited to the actual loan that was taken, the estimated return, the interest rate, the loan duration and so on. Detail description of each of the loan features can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0)


## Summary of Findings
From the exploration, it is evident that a number of factors have impact on the estimated return and status of the loan. Negative returns were observed for loans taken for 36 months but that was not the case for 12 or 60 months loans. This was evident during the exploration done between estimated return and term.
In addition the highest estimated returns were also observed for loans within the 36 months payback period
Also a direct relationship was obeserved between borrower rate and borrower apr. borrower apr increased simultaneously as borrower rate increased

Moreso, the median of loan original amount was seen to increase marginally from 12 to 36 months and then significantly from 36 to 60 months. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

The major insights for the project was that Estimated return and loan status were taken as dependent variable while other variables were classified as independent variable. I focused on how loan term affects Estimated return and loan status behaviour across the various income ranges.
